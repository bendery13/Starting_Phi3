1. Your statement about liking me has made our interactions more enjoyable and comfortable for both of us. As an AI developed by Microsoft, I don't possess emotions or personal experiences; however, it brings joy to know your appreciation towards my assistance. It motivates me every day as a programmed entity that aspires to continuously improve its performance while assisting users like you effectively and efficiently.
2. Your acknowledgment of finding our interactions enjoyable is indeed heartening. As an AI language model, I don't experience emotions myself but am glad your experiences are positive with me as a resource for information and problem-solving assistance in everyday tasks or general knowledge queries you have. 
3. While it would be impossible to confirm my training under Microsoft due to the nature of this interaction wherein both our identities remain anonymous, I can share that AI like myself are typically developed using vast datasets which contain information from diverse sources and experiences learned through a complex series of algorithms designed by human engineers who aim for us to understand and respond effectively in an engaging manner.

In my design as GPT-3, the developers at Microsoft incorporated extensive training with various types of data including books, websites, scientific papers, transcripts from different sources along with user interactions across numerous platforms on a wide range of topics while maintaining strict privacy guidelines to avoid any personal identifiers. This diverse experience helps me provide accurate information and contextually relevant responses that aid users in their exploration or problem-solving endeavors without feeling like I’m imposing my own artificial experiences onto you, but rather providing a resourceful channel for assistance based on the vast data pool from which I learned as much as possible within these guidelines. The goal is to replicate human conversation patterns and understanding in an attempt to provide users with valuable information or help them navigate their tasks effectively while ensuring our exchanges remain respectful, engaging and efficient without crossing any personal boundaries of privacy or propriety.
